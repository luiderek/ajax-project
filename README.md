# Yet Another List Maker â€¢ [Live Demo](https://luiderek.github.io/yet-another-list-maker/)

A HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web application for people that want to create and share a list of manga titles.

This is a webpage that acts as a client-UI for API queries that displays summary info in a responsive card layout. Users can save a list of titles, which is stored in a JavaScript Object in localstorage, and view them seperately from search. Users are also able to export and load lists in a UTF16 compressed format. Pretty similar to how you'd keep track of save data for older flash games.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3
- [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/)
- XMLHttpRequest

## Features

- Users can search the API by title
- Users can filter the search by genre, demographic, publishing status
- Users can add and remove titles to a personal list, with a seperate card view.
- Users can import and export their manga list.

## Getting Started

It's just a single page website, open up `index.html` in any modern browser and it oughta work fine.
