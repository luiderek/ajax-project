# Yet Another List Maker

A HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project.

This is a client UI to make API queries (using [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)) to the [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/), that displays summary info in a responsive card layout.

Also able to export and load lists in a cursed UTF16 compressed format due to the limitations of single page webapps without a backend. Similar to how you'd keep track of save data for old flash games.
